# To-Do-List-v1.0
Basic To do list for daily life and work. Built using node and Express JS with EJS.

 EJS
 
 I used Embedded Javascript templating to print out the current date on the to do list.
 I also used EJS to help add new items to the lists.
 EJS also provided for easy layouts. I was able to just put my header and footer code into 2 seperate ejs files and include them in all my other files using the <%- include("header"); -%> command.
 
 Express
 
 I used Express to render the web pages on the server side and to perform the appropriate get and post requests for the forms and pages.
 Date calculation was also done on the server side.
